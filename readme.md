### Python API Scaffold: [Pellerex.com](https://pellerex.com/ "Pellerex.com")
This scaffold is used to accelerate development of AI powered APIs for Pellerex AI platform.

You should use this scaffold if you are a data scientist building AI models to be deployed using Pellerex Machine Learning as a Service infrastructure.

It supports the below features:

- Basic template to build APIs using [Flask-RESTful](http://https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "Flask-RESTful")
- [Docker file](https://www.docker.com/ "Docker file") to container your Python API and test it prior to deployment

Pellerex AI is a modern Machine learning as a Service (MLaaS) platform which enables data scientists, engineers and companies who develop AI models to run, share, demo and monetise their live models using Pellerex infrastructure.

Pellerex provides your teams with the below capabilities out of the box
- [Profiles](https://pellerex.com/contributors "Profile") for data scientists, engineers and companies to demo their AI models live
- Dedicated [pages](https://pellerex.com/models "pages") to show case your live models
- Enabling data scientists to monetise their work using subscription plans
- Enabling your clients to request a change to your models or talk to you directly regarding those changes
- Fully automated CI/CD pipelines to build and deploy your models and APIs, which will make them available to your clients within a few minutes
- Versioning your models & APIs to provide different implementation and versions to your clients
- Public/Private endponts for those clients who want exclusive access to your models in case they have provided confidential data to train the models

Pellerex AI is agnostic of any programming stack, and you can run your AI models regardless of how it has been built, as long as you can containerise your application, and expose the functions in the form of API endpoints.
